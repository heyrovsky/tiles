so what i can do here is create a branch named tiles-metadata and push the whole thing to the remote repo

and when cloning before cloning the remote repo what i can do is check the metadata repo for detials such as
- version
- archive and so many more

then if the conditions matches i can start cloning

in the metadata i can also add further metadata detials of the project

see the repo structure goes like this

- tiles-orchestrator-metadata
- tiles-tile-<NAME_OF_THE_TILE>
- tiles-results-<NAME_OF_THE_TILE>
